### What is a plugin?

A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. 

In the WordPress community, there is a saying that goes around: “there’s a plugin for that”. They make it easy for users to add features to their website without knowing a single line of code. 

There are thousands available for free to download at the [official WordPress plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/).
