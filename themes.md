### What is a Theme?

A WordPress theme provides all of the front end styling of your WordPress site.

Most WordPress themes provide:

* the overall design or style of your site
* font styling
* colors
* widget locations
* page layouts \(or templates\)
* styles for blog posts and blog archives
* additional stylistic details

Themes take the content and data stored by WordPress and display it in the browser. When you create a WordPress theme, you decide how that content looks and is displayed. There are many options available to you when building your theme. For example:

* Your theme can have different layouts, such as static or responsive, using one column or two.
* Your theme can display content anywhere you want it to be displayed.
* Your theme can specify which devices or actions make your content visible.
* Your theme can customize its typography and design elements using CSS.
* Other design elements like images and videos can be included anywhere in your theme.

WordPress themes are incredibly powerful. But, as with every web design project, a theme is more than color and layout. Good themes improve engagement with your website’s content _in addition_ to being beautiful.

There are only **two files absolutely required in a WordPress** theme:

1. `index.php` – the main template file
2. `style.css` – the main style file
