# Introduction to frameworks

 A framework is a theme containing a basic skeleton that makes it easy to bolt on additional functionality and customize the front end. According to the [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Frameworks):

> Frameworks are for theme developers. They offer a set of standards for theme developers to use in creating their own themes. They’re a set of functions/features created to aid development.

However, theme frameworks aren’t the finished product. They work as developmental templates but aren’t themes themselves. If you’ve ever installed a standalone WordPress theme on your website, it usually works right out of the box. In contrast, theme frameworks don’t work right from the get-go — at the very least they need a child theme to be usable.

Aside from usability, WordPress theme frameworks are more feature-rich compared to standalone themes. The entire functionality is packed neatly into the framework \(potentially along with additional plugins\), while a child theme is used for the design. Standalone themes, on the other hand, pack both the functionality and theme into a single package.

In a nutshell, while they’re not going to be ready to go straight away, with some tinkering WordPress theme frameworks offer stellar flexibility in terms of customization.

**There are a number of advantages to using theme frameworks:**

**Speedy development.** As a web developer, you may have found yourself making the same customizations over and over again to different themes. Theme frameworks save you from having to reinvent the wheel every time you start a new project.

**A solid code base.** When you’re working with a reputable theme framework, you can rest assured that it’s built on a solid coding foundation. Well-written, standardized code will follow [WordPress’ best practices](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/). In addition, you won’t have to worry about compatibility issues.

**Flexibility.** We’ve all had clients who [don’t know](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/clients-from-hell/) what they want. In cases like these, it’s crucial you prepare ahead of time. Given their flexibility, theme frameworks enable you to prepare for unforeseen design modifications and builds, and gives you a cushion to extend the underlying functionality if the client’s requirements change later on.

**Support and community.** Premium WordPress theme frameworks come with unparalleled support from the developers. Even if you choose not to extend your limited-time support, you’re still in safe hands. Theme frameworks typically have a large user base and an active community, and can even save you a few bucks on support.

And the disadvantage being **A potentially steep learning curve.** Working your way around a framework is much tougher than a normal theme, and you may need to get used to its idiosyncrasies — especially if it’s your first time using one. You’ll definitely want to rely on the framework’s documentation to get up to speed. However, once you’ve got it, you’re good to go.

Lets dig in to some of the free theme frameworks available:
