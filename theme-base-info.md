# Theme Base Info

Everytime we work on our theme, before we get started, you will need to fire up your development environment. This consists of starting MAMP, opening your project in NetBeans, and starting your gulp task in terminal. When you start your gulp task in terminal, your browser window should automatically open with your local site. 

Whenever we make changes to the theme, because we have browsersync running, the browser will automatically reload. 

We now need to the set up the themes basic info. 

Lets go into the Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Themes. You'll see that there is only the very bare minimum details for the current theme we're using. We need to change that info, and where we do that is in our style.scss file. 

Open up the file and we'll edit the top details to give our theme more context. Reload your Dashboard, click on the Theme Details and you'll see the edits we've just made. 

Once we've completed building our theme, we'll add a screenshot.png to the theme folder and then we'll have an image for the theme.
