# WordPress.com VS WordPress.org

### WordPress.com

| Pros: | Cons: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| It’s free for upto 3GB of space. After that you will have to pay for space \($19.95 per year for 5GB\) or \($289.97 per year for 100GB\). | They place ads on all free websites. Did you really think it was free without a catch? If you don’t want your users to see ads, then you can pay them $29.97 per year to keep your site ad-free. |
|  | You cannot use custom themes. Yup, you have to be stuck with their choice of themes which is being used on hundreds of millions of sites. They do offer a “design upgrade” which should really be called CSS upgrade for $30 per year. Meaning, you can change the color of your site. But if you want to add something really custom, you cannot. |

### WordPress.org

| Pros: | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| It’s free and super easy to use.  | Like any other website, you need a good web hosting. This bits cost you money somewhere from around $3 – $7 per month \(as your site grows, your hosting costs will too\). But then you would be making enough money to cover the costs :\) |
| You own your data. You are in full control. Your site will NOT be turned off because someone decides that it is against their terms of service \(as long as you are not doing something illegal\). You are in control. | You are responsible for updates. WordPress upgrades require 1 click \(Not too hard eh\). |
| You can upload and use plugins. | You are responsible for backups, but thankfully tons of amazing plugins are out there like BackupBuddy. |
| You can upload custom themes. Modify theme files \(not just styles\) if needed. | You are responsible to prevent SPAM, but if you enable Akismet \(which comes built-in with WordPress.org\), then you won’t have to worry about it. |
| You can make money from it by using your own ads, and doing things your way. |  |
