# Conclusion

From this course you're walking away with the skills to build your own Themes from scratch using the Underscores Theme. What you have is the starting point for your own custom Theme. You can use what we built, tweak it, or pull it apart and build something different, or  start from scratch with your own designs.

Throughout the course you've often heard me use the WordPress Developer Reference found at developer.wordpress.org this is the new site for all Developer documentation and it replaces the old WordPress Codex.

Even so, the WordPress Codex is still available and sometimes you'll find better information there. Anytime you encounter a function you want to know more information about, or you're looking to add, or change functionality on your site developer.wordpress.org should be your first stop.

Good luck with the rest of your WordPress Journey.
